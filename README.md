This project had me use the Mango database program as my database, throught this experience I was able to properly create a functional backend that could recieve and send data. I had troubles with models and controllers, but eventually overcame these setbacks through reaserch and refinement.

## Installation

[Repository](https://github.com/B-R-Ls/Profile-Manager)

## Usage

With the use of a API client such as Insomnia, Postman, or ThunderClient, you can call upon a Mango Database. With this database you can get, create, edit, and delete information for users, thoughts, and reactions.
